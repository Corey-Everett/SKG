Weekly Progress Update #1 – October 29th, 2018

What did your team do last week? – We incorporated and spoke about what we would need to do to complete the program, creating 
the outline for a successful completion; a weekly meeting on Monday and in-person testing.

What will your team do this week? We intend to continue working on storing information, figuring out the logistics 
behind a GUI model for client and server. Once this has been determined, we can think about the exact functions of 
our program and how it will interpret the information we give it.

Any blocking issues/challenges that need to be addressed? Currently, we are unable to provide storage permeance; 
The information disappears as the server does. Debate on data structures. Importing from GitHub required a workaround. 
Better completion will involve becoming more familiar with GitHub itself and how to pull/push our software effectively. 
Currently, we are also unable to implement several of the concepts required for the program’s completion,
which will require further study.
