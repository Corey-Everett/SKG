# Progress Updates (Oct 29 - Nov 30)

## Week 1 (Oct 29 - Nov 5)

### What did your team do last week?
* We incorporated and spoke about what we would need to do to complete the program
* Created the outline for a successful completion 
* Agreed upon a weekly meeting on Monday and in-person testing.

### What will you do this week? 
* We intend to continue working on storing information
* Figure out the logistics  behind a GUI model for client and server.
* Determine the exact functions of our program 
* Find out how it will interpret the information we give it

### Any blocking issues/challenges that need to be addressed? 
* Unable to provide storage permeance; 
* Information is not stored after the server is closed
* Data structures
* Importing from GitHub required a workaround. 
* Understanding how to use GitHub properly (pushing and pulling)
* Unable to implent several of the concepts required for our program

## Week #2 (Nov 5 - Nov 12)

### What did your team do last week?
* Made it so the program allowed communication between the Client and Server
* Laid the groundwork for completion of this program in a timely manner. 

### What will your team do this week? 
* Intend to have a file in which information can be stored regarding games and such
* Figure out how best to read the file and store/delete information within. 

### Any blocking issues/challenges that need to be addressed? 
* Unable to provide storage permeance (The information disappears as the server does)
* Debate on data structures
* Importing from GitHub required a workaround
* Understanding how to use GitHub properly (pushing and pulling)
* Figuring out how to implement GUI into our program

## Week 3 (Nov 12 - Nov 19)

### What did your team do last week?
* We incorporated and spoke about what we would need to do to complete the program
* Worked on server/client methods.
* Agreed upon a weekly meeting on Monday and Wednesday every week until the end of the term.

### What will you do this week? 
* We intend to continue working on storing information
* Figure out the logistics  behind a GUI model for client and server.
* Figure out how to have the client type multiple commands.
* Determine the exact functions of our program 
* Find out how it will interpret the information we give it

### Any blocking issues/challenges that need to be addressed? 
* Unable to provide storage permeance; 
* Information is not stored after the server is closed.
* Data structures.
* Unable to implement several of the concepts required for our program.
* Server only completes one command before exiting so far.

## Week 4 (Nov 13 - Nov 20)

### What did your team do last week?
* Worked on client methods, like create, help and lookup. 

### What will you do this week? 
* We intend to continue working on storing information. Namely, how to store games and reviews for them. 
* Figure out the logistics behind a GUI model for client and server.
* Figure out how to have the client type multi-part commands, or else consolidate into a single command for each.
* Determine the exact functions of our program. Server and client commands still unclear.
* Find out how it will interpret the information we give it

### Any blocking issues/challenges that need to be addressed? 
* Data structures.
* Features unimplemented; Proper storage, GUI, all commands, for both client and server.
* Server still cannot complete multi-part commands.

## Week 5 (Nov 20 - Nov 27)

### What did your team do last week?
* Worked on client methods, like create, help and lookup.
* Got to implementing create, and fixing data storage issues.

### What will you do this week? 
* We intend to continue working on storing information. Namely, how to store games and reviews for them. 
* Figure out the logistics behind a GUI model for client and server.
* Determine the exact functions of our program. Server and client commands still unclear.
* Think of doing a GUI model, once program is otherwise completed.

### Any blocking issues/challenges that need to be addressed? 
* Data structures - storage and manipulation of info.
* Features unimplemented; Proper storage, GUI, all commands, for both client and server.

# Comments
1. Revise this following the ProgressUpdates.md template for better look and formatting - resolved
2. Better organize the source code (put them in separate folders like how the code gets organized in Java)
