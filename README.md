# Microtransaction Rating Software

What? 

`A software which allows users to rate games by their level of microtransactions.

Why?

The purpose of this program is to shed light on the recent epidemic of “microtransactions” which leave the gaming community up in arms. It has been shown, time and time again, that greedy companies will use every trick in the book to mislead consumers and have them spend more money for the complete game in whatever way they can. They’re a nuisance at best, and a form of gambling for minors at worst. The gaming community needs to know what they’re buying, and now. Enter Microtransaction Rating System. It will arm gamers with the knowledge they need to avoid predatory games and take companies like EA and Zynga to task on their hidden purchases.

How?

By creating a back-and-forth server/client system, we can create a library of games which contain information on microtransactions. The user can search up a game and determine, based on review and rating, what rating is has depends on the reviews. 

# Deliverables 
1. Github SKG repository

2. Server Software
  -A server that allows multiple clients to connect to it. It presents a GUI that is easy to use and allows clients to create or lookup a review for a game.
3. Client Software
  -Give users options to either create or lookup reviews for games (implementing a GUI to make it look prettier)
4. GUI
  -Create a presentable GUI that is easy to use and allows the users to lookup and create reviews for any game.
5. Presentation
  -Our expectations for this presentation is to deliver a working program that has a server and client communicating with each other. It should also explain the importance of understanding how the companies can try and trick you into buying a "incomplete" game where you must use more money to recieve extra perks.

# Plan
* Week 1 (October 29th 7-9pm):
- Discuss what is needed to start the project
* Week 2 (Nov 5th 7-9pm):
-Create a functional server-client back and forth
* Week 3 (Nov 12th 7-9pm):
- Polish off the server's functionality, begin on GUI
* Week 4 (Nov 19th 7-9pm):
- Work on GUI and create what starts to look like software, discuss how final project will look
* Week 5 (Nov 26th 7-9pm):
- Create functions for reviewing and deleting reviews
* Week 6 (Dec 3rd 7-9pm):
- Finish project and have a presentable version of it.

# Features

Our program lets multiple clients connect to a server to either create a review for a game, lookup a review for a specific game, or lookup a review for every game that has a review. The games are stored in a text file which allows the server to store them permanently and display the reviews written by the clients if the client requests it.
