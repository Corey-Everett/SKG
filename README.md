# Microtransaction Rating Software

What? 

`A software which allows users to rate games by their level of microtransactions.

Why?

The purpose of this program is to shed light on the recent epidemic of “microtransactions” which leave the gaming community up in arms. It has been shown, time and time again, that greedy companies will use every trick in the book to mislead consumers and have them spend more money for the complete game in whatever way they can. They’re a nuisance at best, and a form of gambling for minors at worst. The gaming community needs to know what they’re buying, and now. Enter Microtransaction Rating System. It will arm gamers with the knowledge they need to avoid predatory games and take companies like EA and Zynga to task on their hidden purchases.

How?

By creating a back-and-forth server/client system, we can create a library of games which contain information on microtransactions. The user can search up a game and determine, based on review and rating, what rating is has depends on the reviews.
